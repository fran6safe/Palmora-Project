# 🧠 Palmora HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my **Palmora HR Analytics Dashboard**, a comprehensive data visualization project created as part of my Business Intelligence training at **The Incubator Hub**. This project simulates an HR analysis task for a fictional company, **Palmora Group**, using realistic employee data to provide insights into workforce demographics, compensation, and performance.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms raw HR data into actionable insights. The key business questions we aimed to answer included:

- What is the average salary across departments and locations?
- Is there salary equity between male and female employees?
- How are employees distributed across departments?
- How does employee performance vary across gender and departments?
- What’s the overall gender composition of the workforce?

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

The dataset mimics real HR data from Palmora Group and includes the following fields:

| Column Name       | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `Name`            | Employee full name                          |
| `Gender`          | Male or Female                              |
| `Department`      | Business unit (e.g., Marketing, Finance)    |
| `Location`        | Office location (e.g., Lagos, Ogun)         |
| `Rating`          | Performance rating (Good, Average, Poor...) |
| `Salary`          | Monthly salary (in Naira)                   |
